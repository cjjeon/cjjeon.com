                                            . I&apos;ve always dreamed of becoming an engineer and
                                            this was a step to achieve my dream. Not only that, this
                                            was the first time that I was moving away from my family
                                            and friends and going to a place that I had never been
                                            before. It was an exciting but also frightening experience
                                            at the same time.

                                            The work was mainly on calculating and displaying the

                                            substations. This gave me chance to, extract the data from
                                            different sources (SAP, Database, Excel, etc), write the

                                            manages the entire project from start to end, and a SCADA
                                            engineer who design a communication system in a

                                            specialized in power systems. I learn mostly about high
                                            voltage systems (power lines you see on the road) but
                                            there were not many jobs opportunity at the time.

                                            So, I decided to search for jobs related to electrical
                                            engineering. Thankfully, the field is broad and I can
                                            still apply for a different position.

                                            software engineer. I was building a prototype for IoT
                                            devices. I build a lot of cool stuff from designing PCB,
                                            soldering smd components, and creating servers. This is
                                            probably the time that I actually fell in love working
                                            with micro-controllers.
